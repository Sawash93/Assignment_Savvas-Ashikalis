SNAKE MOBILE GAME

A floating joystick is used (from a package)
Food type (randomly between blue and red) is Spawned through the FoodSpawner in a random location in the game area
Snake Bodies are spawned everytime Food is consumed
Snake Bodies Follow the Player Rigidybody and attempt to "Push" him on the edge of the map 
on the edge colliders on the wall detect collision and cause lose conditions
when the player loses a game canvas is set to true/active which shows current score which is being tracked in the game session.
